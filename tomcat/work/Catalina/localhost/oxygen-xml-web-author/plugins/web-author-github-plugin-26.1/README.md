Oxygen XML Web Author Git Connector
=======================
This plugin enables Oxygen XML Web Author to open and commit files on Git repositories.
        
Browsing
--------
Oxygen XML Web Author includes Git file browsing functionality in the Dashboard and in the file choosers in the editor (for example, actions to create new files, browse for existing files, upload files, change the repository/branch, and login/logout).

Commit
------
When you open a Git file, a *Git* button appears on the toolbar. In its drop-down menu, there is a "Commit on Git repository" action. When you perform that action, you will be asked to provide:
 * The commit message
 * (optional) The name of a new branch on which this commit goes
